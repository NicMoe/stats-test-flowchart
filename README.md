# stats-test-flowchart

Goals of this project:

  - Target audience are stats students
  - Webapp worthy
  - Easy to update
  - Created in GitHub so it can easily evolve into an open-source project
  - Include flowchart format
  - Made in such a way that user can understand and test assumptions without leaving main flow
  - Distinction between: fork-in-road page, statistical test page, biography page
  - Interesting (tangential) info includes biography pages and descriptors of concepts such as interactives, videos, and other cool resources

Fork-in-road page:
	- Follows simple two (or more) option question format
	- Accordions info on how to test for (or answer) question
	- Links to interesting (but tangential) info

Statistical test page:
	- Explains use of test with info on how to compute (ideally by hand, but also in stats programs)
	- Reiterates assumptions with accordions to understand how to test for each assumption
	- Links to interesting (but tangential) info
  
Future components:
  - Include spatial stats concepts
  - Fill in survival analysis branch
  - Fill in prediction branch
  - Include better math symobolization
  - Include links (where appropriate) within content
