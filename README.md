# stats-test-flowchart

Goals of this project:

- webapp worthy
- easy to update
- created in GitHub so it can easily evolve into an open-source project
- include flowchart format
- made in such a way that user can understand and test assumptions without leaving main flow
- distinction between: fork-in-road page, statistical test page, biography page
- interesting (tangential) info includes biography pages and descriptors of concepts such as interactives, videos, and other cool resources

Fork-in-road page:
	- Follows simple two (or more) option question format
	- Accordions info on how to test for (or answer) question
	- Links to interesting (but tangential) info

Statistical test page:
	- Explains use of test with info on how to compute (ideally by hand, but also in Stata and other stat programs)
	- Reiterates assumptions with accordions to understand how to test for each assumption
	- Links to interesting (but tangential) info
